### Design

The site has a very simple and clean design which was purposely chosen in order to keep in theme with the site's goal. i.e. invoking a sense of calm in the user and reducing stress. 

#### Colour Scheme
Colour palette from Coolors

![Colour Palette](docs/readme_images/colour_scheme.png)

The colour scheme of the site is mainly pale white , Blue and green . The colours chosen are quite neutral and calming. 

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility. 

#### Imagery
The mostely images are from user posts , uploaded to cloudinary DB. logo and main Banner and i have created myself.
#### Fonts
The Georgia serif and Roboto Slab serif font is the main font used for the body of the website with the Playfair Display font used for the main headings on the home page. These fonts were imported via Google Fonts. Sans Serif is the backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here]()

The 16 user stories were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone. Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Data Model
I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views.  

Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.

In order for the users to create Post a custom Post model was required. The Post author is a foreign key to the User model given a post can only have one author.

The Comment model allows users to comment on individual Post and the Post is a foreign key in the comment model given a comment can only be linked to one Post. 


The diagram below details the database schema.
