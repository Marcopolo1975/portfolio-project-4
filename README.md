## User Experience (UX)
Creating a delightful and intuitive user experience for a travel blog app is essential
to engage users and encourage them to share and explore travel content. Here are some 
key UX principles and features that should be incorporated into the app to enhance 
user satisfaction:

### User Stories

#### View paginated list of posts
- As a site user I can view a paginated list of posts so that I can select which post I want to view
- Acceptance criteria
- Given more than one post in the database, these multiple posts are listed.
- When a user opens the main page a list of posts is seen.
  Then the user sees all post titles with pagination to choose what to read.
#### User Navigation

#### User stories not yet implemented

The following user stories were scoped out of the project due to time constraints. It is intended that these user stories will be implemented at a later date. 

- As a Site User, I can bookmark a posts so that i can view my favorite posts later.

### Design

The site has a very simple and clean design which was purposely chosen in order to keep in theme with the site's goal. i.e. invoking a sense of calm in the user and reducing stress. 

#### Colour Scheme
Colour palette from Coolors

![Colour Palette](docs/images/colers.png)

The colour scheme of the site is mainly pale white , Blue and green . The colours chosen are quite neutral and calming. 

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility. 

#### Imagery
The mostely images are from user posts , uploaded to cloudinary DB. logo and main Banner and i have created myself.
#### Fonts
The Georgia serif and Roboto Slab serif font is the main font used for the body of the website with the Playfair Display font used for the main headings on the home page. These fonts were imported via Google Fonts. Sans Serif is the backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/Marcopolo1975/projects/6/views/1)

The 16 user stories were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone. Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Data Model
I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views.  

Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.

In order for the users to create Post a custom Post model was required. The Post author is a foreign key to the User model given a post can only have one author.

The Comment model allows users to comment on individual Post and the Post is a foreign key in the comment model given a comment can only be linked to one Post. 


The diagram below details the database schema.

## Testing

## Code Validation
The code on the 'Explorer blog' site has been tested through W3C Markup Validation Service, W3C CSS Validation Service and JSHint. Errors were at first found on the site in the W3C Markup Validation Service but could quite easily be fixed.

### Markup Validation
After fixing the inital errors that W3C Markup Validation Service reported, no errors were returned.

<details><summary><b>HTML Validation Result</b></summary>

![HTML Result Home Page](docs/images/htmlvalidation.png)

### CSS Validaton
When validating my own code the W3C CSS Validator reports no errors.

<details><summary><b>CSS Validation Result</b></summary>

![CSS Result](docs/images/cssvalidation.png)
</details><br/>


### PEP Validation

All Python files were run through Pep8 with no errors found.


### Responsiveness Test
The responsive design tests were carried out manually with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Responsive Design Checker](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php).

### Browser Compatibility
* Google Chrome Version (106.0.5249.119)

* Apple Safari (version 16.0)
* Microsoft Edge (version 106.0.1370.47)


## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User Authentication

- Django's user authentication is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. 
- Django's UserPassesTest is used to limit access based on certain permissions i.e. to ensure users can only edit/delete posts and comments for which they are the author. If the user doesn't pass the test they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error. 

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom error pages:

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request - The Easy Eater is unable to handle this request.
- 403 Page Forbidden - Looks like you're trying to access forbidden content. Please log out and sign in to the correct account.
- 404 Page Not Found - The page you're looking for doesn't exist.
- 500 Server Error - The Easy Eater is currently unable to handle this request

- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
- Next select your region.
- Click on the Create App button.

### Attach the Postgres database:
- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.
- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.

### Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
- In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file. 
- Update the settings.py file to import the env.py file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
- Comment out the default database configuration.
- Save files and make migrations.
- Add Cloudinary URL to env.py
- Add the cloudinary libraries to the list of installed apps.

- Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku.
- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

### Create files / directories
- Create requirements.txt file
- Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.
